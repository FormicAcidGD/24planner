## Issues & Suggestions

If you wish to report any bugs or want to give feedback, you are very welcome to do so!  
It greatly aids development.

    1. Open an issue and tag it either `Bug Report` or `Feedback`
    2. Describe the issue as well as possible
    3. Propose possible solutions that you think would suit the program

# Contributing

To contribute you can either tackle one of the roadmap items or do your own thing. Code will be reviewed by me (Zedruc) before accepting it.  
General Guideline:

1. **Do NOT** reformat a whole file and push that, as it makes code review harder, which will 100% lead to rejection of pull requests.

* Default indent tab = 2 spaces

2. The only API allowed to be used is `api.zedruc.net` (Not documented as it only has one endpoint for the suite anyway), any features using      external APIs I will add myself.
